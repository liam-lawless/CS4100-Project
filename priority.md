## Priority List
*What needs to be accomplished next?*

**TODO**
- Implement adversaries
- Implement QLearning
- Implement more actions
    - flee
    - return home
    - die of old age
    - sated (or should it be kept as greedy i.e. agents eat as much as they want)
    - reproduce 
- Implement generations
- Implement graphs and visualizations
- Document code
- Unit Test
- Unrelated to code base, create powerpoint presentation for project


Needs to happen eventually in no apparent order:
- Circle back to the cost function to determine how much energy is used per step
